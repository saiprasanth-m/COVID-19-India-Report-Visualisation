# COVID-19-India-Report-Visualisation
Simple Visualisation of the official corona updates of india with [state-wise details](https://github.com/saiprasanth-m/COVID-19-India-Report-Visualisation/tree/master/State-wise%20Reports) and updating [daily statistics](https://github.com/saiprasanth-m/COVID-19-India-Report-Visualisation/tree/master/Date-wise%20Reports) with the previous data available can be easily done using this program. The data is collected from the official website of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare using [*web scrapping*](https://www.webharvy.com/articles/what-is-web-scraping.html) techniques. These data are processed and visualised using *matplotlib* library with bar chart representations.

# Tutorial
1. Web Scrapping - Extraction of large amount of data from any website and further process it for useful outputs. This technique is utilized with the help of [*BeautifulSoup*](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) python library.
2. Data Visualisation - Representation of useful data in different approaches to study/analyze. This method includes the use of [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) library.

Further implementation of reports/visual graphs generation is being developed.
