Simple Visualisation of the official corona update with state-wise details and updating daily statistics with the previous data available. The data is collected from the official website of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare using *web scrapping* techniques. These data are processed and visualised using *matplotlib* library with bar chart representations.
