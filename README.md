# COVID-19-India-Report-Visualisation
Simple Visualisation of the official corona updates of india with state-wise details and updating daily statistics with the previous data available can be easily done using this program. The data is collected from the official website of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare using [*web scrapping*](https://www.webharvy.com/articles/what-is-web-scraping.html) techniques. These data are processed and visualised using *matplotlib* library with bar chart representations.

# Tutorial
1. Web Scrapping - Extraction of large amount of data from any website and further process it for useful outputs. This technique is utilized with the help of [*BeautifulSoup*](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) python library.
2. Data Visualisation - Representation of useful data in different approaches to study/analyze. This method includes the use of [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) library.

Further implementation of reports/visual graphs generation is being developed.
